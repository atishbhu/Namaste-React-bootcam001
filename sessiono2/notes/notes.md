### JSX:- 

- React also support JSX syntax. JSX is an extention created by Facebook that adds XML syntax to javascript. In order to use you need to include babel library.
- Every JSX is converted to the React.createElement function call that the browser understands.
- JSX is a syntax invented for React that looks very similar to HTML. It allows you to create elements by writing in a familiar-looking syntax, instead of writing out function calls by hand. The HTML-like syntax actually compiles down to real JavaScript.

### JSX is compiled into JavaScript:-

- The JSX elements you write are actually compiled down to JavaScript by a tool called Babel. Babel is a compiler that transforms code into valid ES5 JavaScript that all browsers can understand and Babel is a bundler.
- Each JSX element becomes a function call, where its arguments are its attributes (“props”) and its contents (“children”).
